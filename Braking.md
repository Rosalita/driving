There is more to breaking than just pressing the brake pedal

- To avoid stalling when braking, the clutch must go down when the revs drop to around 1000 RPM.
- Don't get into the habit of pressing the clutch down every time see a hazard as might only need to brake a little bit. If the clutch is pressed down for no reason, it takes time to bring the clutch back up again.
- It's also not necessary to change gear as soon as the clutch goes down. Focus attention on braking first, speed before gear.

[[Progressive Braking]] is a technique to break safely by separating the braking into three stages.
- Apply the break gently until can just feel the break start to work. 
- Firm up the breaking force by break firmly this is when the car will slow down.
- Feather off the break pedal taking the foot off the pedal lightly.
