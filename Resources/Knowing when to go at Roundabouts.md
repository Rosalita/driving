[Knowing when to go at Roundabouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuJc22m3kj4)

Look at the wheels and speed of cars on roundabout.
- If they are straight, they are coming off and can go
- If the are steering they are staying on and can't go
- If they are going fast, they are coming off and can go
- If they are going slow, they are staying on and can't go
- If they are indicating, that helps

Be ready when stopped at roundabout. Be in first gear with foot over gas pedal and hand on handbrake.
