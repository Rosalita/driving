[Clutch or Brake First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl9qTbZH4tM)

Synopsis: If the revs are low, press the clutch first before braking to avoid stalling. If the revs are high, brake first then clutch. In emergency stop, press both together. On a hill, use clutch only, this is because the hill will slow you down.
