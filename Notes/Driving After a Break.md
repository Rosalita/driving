# Driving After a Break

I started to learn to drive in February 2020.

I am currently on my 2nd break from lessons due to lockdown which could go on for a significant amount of time.

After my first break from driving during the 1st lockdown I notice that
- I was overly anxious about driving again after having months with no driving.
- My skills at controlling the car and observation skills had deteriorated.
- My confidence had also deteriorated.
- It was extremely scary.

During this current lockdown it is important that I don't forget how to drive so I can try to pick up where I was when lessons are allowed to start again.
